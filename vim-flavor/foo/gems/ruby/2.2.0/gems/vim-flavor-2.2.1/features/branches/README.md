Sometimes it's necessary to try out proposed changes of a Vim plugin which are
not released as a proper version.  So that `vim-flavor` can also track the
latest revision of a specific branch of a Vim plugin.

Unlike plain versions, branches are not comparable.  So that it's not possible
to detect incompatible plugins before installing.  It's not recommended for
daily use.  Use branches at your own risk.
